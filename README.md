# USA Spending MCP Server

This is a stateless streamable HTTP MCP server for interacting with [USASPENDING.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/), the official source of government spending data.
You can track government spending over time, search government spending by agency, explore government spending to communities, and much more.
USASPENDING.gov provides this neat [dashboard](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) which shows some of the powers of the API should you want a high level overview of what you can achieve with this API.
The API docs can be viewed at this [URL](https://api.usaspending.gov/docs/).

### tools directory explained
This is a big API with a lot of routes so all tools are organized in the tools directory.
There is a md file for each tool so it is convenient to reference the documentation used to create the tool.
Currently, all contracts (aka API documentation) are referenced from commit [dv551d0](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/commit/db551d0ab224cfde5a22a99cada44b7746c689b1) of the usaspending-api.
At the moment, each tool is manually created using the contract documentation as a reference.
The current plan is to make all API routes available to this MCP server.
In the future, the process of copying a contract over and using it to create a new tool will be automated.

## Testing
[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a good way to test the input and output schema without connecting to a LLM.
There is also a sample [MCP Client](test/README.md) to test the application using OpenAI.

## Contributing
Please see the [testing](#testing) section as a starting point to test your changes before submitting a PR.
If you are adding a new tool, please also add a copy of the respective contract used as a reference to create the `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`.
Please add the tool to the same path that it exists in the usaspending_api [contacts](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/tree/master/usaspending_api/api_contracts/contracts) directory. 
For file naming convention refer to the contract file name and name the tool this as well.
For example, if you are creating a tool for the [v2/disaster/spending_by_geography.md](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/blob/master/usaspending_api/api_contracts/contracts/v2/disaster/spending_by_geography.md) API route this tool should be added with under the path tools/v2/disaster/spending_by_geography.py and the tool should be named disaster_spending_by_geography.
Should there be any objections to this please explain why in the PR as it is not bullet proof!
